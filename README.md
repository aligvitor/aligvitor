Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vitor
Architect and BIM Developer

Throughout my career, I have been committed to developing innovative and sustainable solutions for Architecture and Urban Design projects, leveraging the power of BIM technology and data analysis. My expertise has been focused on providing legal and environmentally-friendly solutions for medium and large infrastructure and real estate developments across Brazil, such as highways, logistics facilities, hospitals, airports, residential, commercial and mixed-use buildings, and entire neighborhood developments. Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you!
